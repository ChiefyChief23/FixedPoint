# Fixed Point - Under Development

This library is to make use of Fixed Point arithmetic which can be found within Mission Critical systems. The Fixed Point methods are used to increase the deterministic nature of the calculations as well as decrease the computational time. 

### Why use Fixed Point?
There are two main reasons for the use of Fixed Point mathematics:
- You need deterministic calculations
- Platform doesn't have a Floating Point Unit or the operations required for floating point calculations lack speed
