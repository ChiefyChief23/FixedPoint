# Fixed Point - Under Development

This library is to make use of Fixed Point arithmetic which can be found within Mission Critical systems. The Fixed Point methods are used to increase the deterministic nature of the calculations as well as decrease the computational time. 

### Why use Fixed Point?
There are two main reasons for the use of Fixed Point mathematics:
- You need deterministic calculations
- Platform doesn't have a Floating Point Unit or the operations required for floating point calculations lack speed

### Available files
As this library is currently under development I have included the GoogleTest unit test file that I am using in conjunction with the library to ensure the proper functionality of the class. This can be used as a reference for functionality on your end but it's just to give an idea and examples of how things are working
